# Exploring-Google-PlayStore-Market
## OverView
In this Project, I analyze the data based on most popular apps and basically find correlations between many options like size of apps, rates vs installs, and version updates. However, I had been stuck at the last part free vs paid apps and I have not tried to complete the project since then but soon I will hopefully be able to complete it. 
## Dependencies
math
numpy
seaborn
